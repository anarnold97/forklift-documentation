= New features and enhancements

{project-first} 2.9 introduces the following features and enhancements:

* In the {project-short} 2.9.0 user interface, you can set the `skipGuestConversion` field to `true` in the migration plan to raw copy the disk of a VMware guest virtual machines (VM) to {rhv-full} during migration. If you raw copy the guest VM, it does not convert the guest VM, install `virtio` drivers, and preserve the IP address. You can use this feature to migrate VMs that fail during migration because of unsupported guest operating systems. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2001[(MTV-2001)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 is integrated with the storage offloading plugin to delegate the disk data copy process to the storage arrays. The disk data is copied by the storage array to a new persistent volume (PV) that is created on {ocp}. This PV can be used by the virtual machine. Since the data copy function is not carried over an IP-based network, the storage offloading helps to copy multi-terabyte data from single disk VMs without clogging the network, resulting in faster migrations. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2241[(MTV-2241)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 supports migrating an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) file with multiple disks by mapping the OVA disks to multiple Storage Classes. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1340[(MTV-1340)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 supports persistence of nested VMware VMs after migrations if nested VMs are configured at source. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2495[(MTV-2495)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 allows users to change the names of the target VMs in the migration plan before migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2087[(MTV-2087)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 supports the `shared` disk property field in the persistent volume claim (PVC) name template that allows you to customize the PVC name for shared disks. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2337[(MTV-2337)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 now preserves the original VM name from the plan custom resource (CR) in the migration CR. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2075[(MTV-2075)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 CLI allows you to add a `display-name` in the `annotations` field of the migration plan. The `display-name` you enter cannot be used for making API calls or CLI operations. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2076[(MTV-2076)]

* {project-short} 2.9.0 user interface has the following improvements:
** Access the *Create Provider* page for supported providers from the *Overview* page in the {project-full} menu. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2210[(MTV-2210)]
** Access the *Health* and the *Settings* tabs from the *Overview* page. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2210[(MTV-2210)]
** Use the upgraded plan wizard page, where the status of the plan aligns with the statuses of the VM migrations. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2547[(MTV-2547)]
