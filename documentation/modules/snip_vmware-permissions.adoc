====
There is an issue with the `forklift-controller` consistently failing to reconcile a migration plan, and subsequently returning an HTTP 500 error. This issue is caused when you specify the user permissions only on the virtual machine (VM).

In {project-short}, you need to add permissions at the datacenter level, which includes storage, networks, switches, and so on, which are used by the VM. You must then propagate the permissions to the child elements.

If you do not want to add this level of permissions, you must manually add the permissions to each object on the VM host required.
