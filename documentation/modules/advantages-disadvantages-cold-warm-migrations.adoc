= Advantages and disadvantages of cold and warm migrations

[role="_abstract"]
The table that follows offers a more detailed description of the advantages and disadvantages of cold migration and warm migration. It assumes that you have installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 on the {ocp} platform on which you installed {project-short}:

.Advantages and disadvantages of cold and warm migrations
|===
|
|*Cold migration*
|*Warm migration*

|*Duration*
|Correlates to the amount of data on the disks. Each block is copied once.
|Correlates to the amount of data on the disks and VM utilization. Blocks may be copied multiple times.

|*Fail fast*
|Convert and then transfer. Each VM is converted to be compatible with {ocp-short} and, if the conversion is successful, the VM is transferred. If a VM cannot be converted, the migration fails immediately.
|Transfer and then convert. For each VM, {project-short} creates a snapshot and transfers it to {ocp}. When you start the cutover, {project-short} creates the last snapshot, transfers it, and then converts the VM.

|*Tools*
a|`virt-v2v` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9), used to convert virtual machines from a foreign hypervisor to run on Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVMs).
a|Containerized Data Importer (CDI), a persistent storage management add-on, and `virt-v2v` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9)

|*Data transferred*
|Approximate sum of all disks
|Approximate sum of all disks and VM utilization

|*VM downtime*
|High: The VMs are shut down, and the disks are transferred.
|Low: Disks are transferred in the background. The VMs are shut down during the cutover stage, and the remaining data is migrated. Data stored in RAM is not migrated.

|*Parallelism*
|Disks are transferred sequentially for each VM. For remote migration to a destination that does not have {project-short} installed, disks are transferred in parallel using CDI.
|Disks are transferred in parallel by different pods.

|*Connection use*
|Keeps the connection to the Source only during the disk transfer.
|Keeps the connection to the Source during the disk transfer, but the connection is released between snapshots.

|*Tools*
|{project-short} only.
|{project-short} and CDI from {virt}.

[NOTE]
====
The preceding table describes the situation for VMs that are running because the main benefit of warm migration is the reduced downtime, and there is no reason to initiate warm migration for VMs that are down. However, performing warm migration for VMs that are down is not the same as cold migration, even when {project-short} uses `virt-v2v` and RHEL 9. For VMs that are down, {project-short} transfers the disks using CDI, unlike in cold migration.

[NOTE]
====
When importing from {vmw}, there are additional factors which impact the migration speed such as limits related to ESXi, vSphere, or VDDK.
